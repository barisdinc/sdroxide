//! Deciding what to tell the board, and how often.
//!
//! Two halves. [`Follower`] is pure and clock-injected: it holds what the board
//! was last told and answers "is there anything to say right now?". [`spawn`]
//! puts it on a thread with a transport, because both links block — the serial
//! one for tens of milliseconds and the board/I²C one for the better part of a
//! second, and neither belongs on the engine's loop.
//!
//! The discipline is the HL2IOBoard's, next door in `sdroxide-hpsdr`:
//!
//! * **Deduplicate on the resolved state, never on the frequency.** A dial
//!   dragged across 14.100–14.350 resolves to the same channel and puts nothing
//!   on the control bus at all; a jump to 145 MHz always does.
//! * **Rate-limit the sending, not the value.** Whatever the state is when the
//!   interval expires is what goes out, so a band change during a fast tune is
//!   never the one that gets dropped.
//! * **A half-sent state is not a state.** A failed transaction forgets what
//!   was sent entirely and starts again from the top.
//! * **Give up rather than retry forever.** A board that has stopped answering
//!   is left alone for the rest of the session and said so, once.
