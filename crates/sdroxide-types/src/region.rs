//! Which ITU / IARU region the station operates in, and the process-wide
//! setting every band-plan lookup reads.
//!
//! The amateur allocations are not the same the world over. 70 cm stops at
//! 440 MHz across most of Europe and runs to 450 MHz in the Americas; 40 m ends
//! at 7.200 in Regions 1 and 3 and at 7.300 in Region 2; the digital and phone
//! sub-bands sit in different places again. A band plan is therefore only
//! meaningful once you know where the operator is.
//!
//! ## Why a global
//!
//! The region is read from [`Band::edges`](crate::Band::edges),
//! [`Band::containing`](crate::Band::containing) and the segment tables — which
//! are called from roughly thirty places across the engine, the UI, the
//! skimmers and the speech announcer, most of them deep inside code that has no
//! business carrying a region parameter. Threading one through all of them
//! would be a large change that buys nothing: a station is in exactly one
//! region, and it does not move.
//!
//! So the region lives in one atomic, set once at startup from the station's
//! config and again whenever the operator changes it (or, on a remote client,
//! whenever the station announces its own). Every entry point that reads it
//! also has an explicit `…_in(region)` twin, which is what the tests use — they
//! run in one process, in parallel, and must never depend on a global one of
//! them might be changing.
