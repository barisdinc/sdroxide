//! An open LimeSDR: the device, its two streams, and everything done to them.
//!
//! # No thread
//!
//! Unlike every native USB backend here this one has no background thread and
//! no ring buffer, because LimeSuite already has both. `LMS_RecvStream` takes a
//! timeout and reads out of LimeSuite's own FIFO, which is exactly the
//! `IqSource::read` contract — so the shape to copy is the SoapySDR source in
//! `sdroxide-radio`, which drives this same library through SoapyLMS7 from the
//! engine thread and has done since before this backend existed.
//!
//! Stacking a second FIFO on top of LimeSuite's would add latency and buy
//! nothing. What it *does* mean is that a slow call — `LMS_Calibrate` above
//! all — must never land in a tuning path; see [`LimeHandle::set_center_hz`].
//!
//! # Both streams are set up at open
//!
//! `LMS_SetupStream` stops LimeSuite's running data threads to make room, which
//! is recorded next door in `sdroxide-radio`'s SoapySDR device as the reason a
//! stream restart there is so disruptive. Creating both directions while the
//! device is idle and then only starting and stopping them means that path is
//! never taken mid-session.
