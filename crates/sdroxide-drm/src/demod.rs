//! [`DrmDemod`] — DRM as a demodulator: channel-rate complex baseband in,
//! decoded programme audio out.
//!
//! It sits where `AmDemod` or `WfmDemod` would, because that is what it is —
//! RF in, sound out, no keyboard, no transmit, no QSO. The differences from an
//! analog demod are all consequences of the decode running on its own thread:
//!
//! * the audio for a block is not made from that block's samples. DRM's time
//!   interleaving alone is 400 ms or 2 s, so what comes back now was
//!   transmitted seconds ago;
//! * the decoder produces audio at the *transmitter's* rate, not ours, so the
//!   two are rate-matched here rather than assumed equal;
//! * there is a status snapshot to hand up, which is what [`take_drm`] is for.
//!
