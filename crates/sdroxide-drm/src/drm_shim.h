/* A C API over Dream's CDRMReceiver, sized to what a host radio needs: push
   baseband samples in, pull decoded audio and a status snapshot out.
 *
 * Threading: the ring is the only object that crosses threads. Everything
 * taking an `sdrx_drm*` — new, process, status, restart, free — must be called
 * on one and the same thread, because Dream's receiver is not internally
 * synchronised and the sound shims find their ring through a thread-local. */
