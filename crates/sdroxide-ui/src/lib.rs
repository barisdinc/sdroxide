///
/// > wgpu error: Validation Error
/// > In `Surface::configure`
/// > Failed to wait for GPU to come idle before reconfiguring the Surface
///
/// The wait wgpu asks for there is indefinite, and on Vulkan, Metal and D3D12
/// it really is. On OpenGL it is `glClientWaitSync`, and wgpu-hal passes that
/// call a timeout clamped to `i32::MAX` — **nanoseconds**, so "wait forever"
/// quietly becomes "wait 2.147 seconds". A GPU that needs longer to finish the
/// frame already in flight than that therefore does not merely stutter: the
/// window dies, and takes the process with it (issue #148, an Intel HD
/// Graphics 4000 on its 2013 OpenGL 4.0 driver, where the *first* frame — every
/// shader compiled, every texture allocated — did not land inside the 2.147 s).
/// Tearing down after that then walks into the queue's own shutdown wait, which
/// the same card misses as well, and *that* one panics inside a destructor —
/// so the process aborts instead of unwinding.
///
/// `AutoFinish` answers such a wait from the value the last submit recorded
/// rather than asking the driver, so a slow frame costs a slow frame and no
/// more. That is sound here in a way it would not be on the other backends:
/// OpenGL defers deleting anything the pipeline still refers to, so nothing is
/// freed under the GPU's feet, and the reason to wait in the first place — a
/// swapchain the application destroys itself — does not exist on OpenGL. It is
/// also what wgpu did on every OpenGL context until gfx-rs/wgpu#4589.
///
/// What the setting really costs is a truthful `Queue::on_completed_work_done`
/// and a truthful `poll(Wait)`, which matter to a reader mapping a buffer the
/// GPU has just written. Nothing in this tree reads back from the GPU — every
/// pass ends on the screen — so there is nothing to be early for.
///
/// `WGPU_GL_FENCE_BEHAVIOR=normal` puts the driver back in charge. (eframe
