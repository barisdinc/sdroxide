//! G3RUH 9600 baud: scrambled NRZ baseband, straight onto the carrier.
//!
//! The other packet speed, and a different animal from [`crate::afsk`]. There
//! are no tones. The bit stream is scrambled, shaped, and applied to the
//! transmitter's modulator as baseband — which on FM means the deviation
//! follows the data directly. A receiver takes it from the discriminator.
//!
//! # The chain, and why the scrambler is here rather than in the framer
//!
//! ```text
//! HDLC bits ──▶ stuff ──▶ NRZI ──▶ scramble ──▶ shape ──▶ FM modulator
//!   (sdroxide-ax25::Framer does the first three)     (this module)
//! ```
//!
//! Direwolf's order, confirmed against its source: `hdlc_send.c` stuffs and
//! NRZI-encodes, then `gen_tone.c` scrambles what comes out. So the scrambler
//! sits *below* the framer, which is why it lives with the modem and not with
//! the HDLC — 300 and 1200 baud AFSK use the same framer and no scrambler at
//! all.
//!
//! # What the scrambler is for
//!
//! Not secrecy — the polynomial is published and every station uses the same
//! one. An FM transmitter cannot carry DC, and a run of identical bits is DC.
//! Scrambling turns any input, including a long idle run of flags, into
//! something that looks random and therefore has no DC content and plenty of
//! transitions for the receiver's clock.
//!
//! It is *multiplicative* (self-synchronising): the shift register is fed the
//! transmitted bit, so a receiver locks on after seventeen bits with no
//! agreement about where the data started. The cost is error multiplication —
//! one bad bit on the air becomes three after descrambling — which is why the
//! FCS matters even more here than at 1200.
