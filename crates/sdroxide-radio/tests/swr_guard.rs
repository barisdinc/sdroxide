//! The SWR guard: stop transmitting into a fault, and stay stopped.
//!
//! Every test here is a bug that reached a live radio. The guard was written on
//! 17 August 2026 and failed its first two on-air tests in a row, both times by
//! sitting silent through a genuine 7.5:1 while the operator watched. Neither
//! failure was in the threshold or the debounce; both were in what the guard
//! demanded before it would believe a reading at all.
//!
//! 1. It required forward power of at least 5 W. A rig with SWR protection
//!    folds its power back BECAUSE the SWR is bad — the IC-7300 dropped to 3 W —
//!    so the floor gated out precisely the emergency it was guarding against.
//! 2. It required forward power to be reported at all. The CI-V driver sends
//!    `TxTelemetry { fwd_w: None, swr: Some(v) }`, so on every Icom the match
//!    arm could never fire and the whole feature was dead code.
//!
//! `trips_with_no_forward_power_reported` is the regression for both, and is
//! the shape of a real Icom: SWR present, forward power absent.
