//! Working a repeater (issue #137): the transmit shift, and the CTCSS tone
//! that has to be under the voice for the repeater to open at all.
//!
//! The shift is checked where it matters — at the *source*, which is what a
//! band-switching accessory and the transmitter itself are told — rather than
//! only in the broadcast state, because a shift that never leaves the state is
//! a number on a screen.
//!
//! The tone is checked by listening to it. The engine's transmit path is a
//! modulator into a DUC, so what the mock front end is handed is real
//! transmitted I/Q; discriminating it back gives the same signal a repeater's
//! decoder sees, and `SubToneDetect` — which was written against off-air
//! signals — says what is in it.
