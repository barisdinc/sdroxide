//! A station with two radios, over real sockets.
//!
//! This is what makes `--server` worth running on a station that has more than
//! one radio: both engines are up, each is reachable in its own right, and
//! neither client is holding the other's radio. `/ws` still means the first
//! radio, because that is what every client written before there was a roster
//! asks for.
//!
//! Its own test binary because it redirects the config directory through the
//! environment, which is process-global — the same reason `radio_config.rs`
//! has one.
