//! The engine host's interface configuration, over a real socket.
//!
//! This is the whole of what makes an SDR's own settings reachable from another
//! machine: the engine announces `radio.json`, the server keeps it and replays
//! it to whoever connects, and an edit sent back is written where the radio is.
//! An RTL-SDR's AGC mode, its ppm correction and its bias tee are not gain
//! stages and have no `DeviceCaps` entry to ride — this lane is the only route
//! they have.
//!
//! The last part of the test is the same lane carrying the biggest change of
//! all: *which interface* the far end has open. On a headless server there is
//! nobody standing at the machine to pick one, so it has to be possible from
//! here, and the radio that comes back has to be announced.
//!
//! Its own test binary because it redirects the config directory through the
//! environment, which is process-global: the tests in `session.rs` read that
//! directory, and must not find it moved out from under them.
