//! Adding and closing a station's radios from a client, over real sockets.
//!
//! This is what lets a station with no screen gain a radio at all: before it,
//! `radios.json` on the server was the only way, and editing it meant
//! restarting the server and dropping everyone on the air to add a dongle.
//!
//! Its own test binary because it redirects the config directory through the
//! environment, which is process-global — the same reason `multi_radio.rs` and
//! `radio_config.rs` have one.
