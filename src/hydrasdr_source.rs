//! An [`IqSource`] for a HydraSDR RFOne driven over USB by the native driver in
//! `sdroxide-hydrasdr` — no SoapySDR, no libhydrasdr, no libusb.

//! Receive only: the trait's transmit methods already default to errors, which
//! is the correct answer for this hardware.
//!
//! Note this is **not** the Airspy R2 backend next door, despite the shared
//! ancestry: the two disagree about how wide `SET_FREQ` is, so neither driver
//! tunes the other's hardware correctly.
